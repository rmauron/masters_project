# Contents of doc folder

This folder should contain the main scientific product of the project
as well as all other files related to it (e.g. co-author comments,
versions, images, etc). It may and likely should also contain
supplementary and exploratory R Markdown files. Once submission or
presentation time has come for the product, files associated with that
process (e.g. response to reviewers) should be placed in here.
